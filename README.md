# Hunt_the_Wumpus

This is one of the most interesting projects in my CS 16x class at Oregon State University. The program create a stimulation of the classic game Hunt the Wumpus on terminal. 

The game includes a monster named Wumpus that killed you right at the moment you entered its room. 

There are 2 pits that pull you like a blackhole ^^, 2 swarms of bats that carry you to a random room.

In addition, a treasure awaits you to pick it up. 

You are trap in a NxN maze and you will have to kill the monster, get the treasure and get out of the maze safely in order to win the game.
